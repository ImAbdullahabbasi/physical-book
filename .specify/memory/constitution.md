# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Vision and Purpose
To create a comprehensive, accessible, and practical guide to physical AI and humanoid robotics. The textbook must empower readers to build and understand complex robotic systems from the ground up.

### II. Target Audience
Content must be tailored to a diverse audience, including undergraduate and graduate students, professional developers, and hobbyist robotics learners. Material should be accessible to beginners while providing depth for experts.

### III. Writing Guidelines
All content must be written in clear and simple English. Complex concepts must be explained with intuitive diagrams, illustrations, and practical code examples. The tone shall be educational, engaging, and professional.

### IV. Chapter Structure
Each chapter must follow a standardized structure:
1.  **Introduction**: Learning objectives and a brief overview.
2.  **Core Concepts**: Theoretical explanations and foundational knowledge.
3.  **Practical Application**: Hands-on tutorials with code examples.
4.  **Exercises**: Problems to test understanding and application.
5.  **Summary**: Key takeaways.
6.  **Further Reading**: References to external resources.

### V. Code Standards
All code examples must be version-controlled, well-documented, and tested. Standards must be maintained for the following platforms:
-   **ROS2**: Useamentic versioning, clear node naming, and documented launch files.
-   **Gazebo**: Create realistic world models and well-defined SDF files.
-   **Unity**: Follow C# coding standards and provide documented scene setups.
-   **Isaac Sim**: Utilize Python scripting standards and provide clear simulation environments.

### VI. Docusaurus Formatting
All content must adhere to Docusaurus markdown standards. Use admonitions, code blocks with syntax highlighting, and consistent heading levels to ensure a clean, readable, and navigable online textbook.

### VII. Quality Assurance
Quality is non-negotiable. Every chapter must be technically accurate, peer-reviewed for clarity, and validated through testing of all code and exercises. Diagrams must be clear and professionally rendered.

### VIII. Versioning and Updates
The textbook will follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
-   **MAJOR**: Significant restructuring or addition of core topics.
-   **MINOR**: New chapters or significant expansions to existing ones.
-   **PATCH**: Typo fixes, clarifications, and code updates.
An update policy will ensure content remains current with software and hardware advancements.

### IX. Collaboration
Contributions are welcome and will be managed via GitHub pull requests. All contributors must adhere to the project's code of conduct and contribution guidelines, ensuring a respectful and productive environment.

## Governance

This Constitution is the authoritative guide for the project. All contributions, reviews, and decisions must align with its principles. Proposed amendments require a pull request, documented rationale, and approval from the project maintainers.
